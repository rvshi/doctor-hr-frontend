# Basic Heart Rate Viewer

For this assignment, you will use your new ReactJS skills and build a minimal frontend viewer for the heart rate information your heart rate web service serves up (from the previous assignment). You should try to use [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com/) components to make your application look professional. At a _minimum_ your application must:

* Allow the user to enter in a patient email (or identifier) and press a button to fetch all of the patient's heart rate measurements. This should be making a `GET` request to the web service you already wrote last assignment
* The heart rates and corresponding times should be displayed in the application.

You will get a _small_ amount of bonus points for going above an beyond to do things like:
* Graph the heart rates over time. Using something like [recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts)
* Autocomplete of patient's email as it's being typed OR a dropdown menu to select from patients in the DB [these may require changes to your backend Flask application)


Grading on this assignment will be lenient as it is understood that Javascript is new to everyone in this class. This assignment will be worth 20 points in the projects category (for reference, primary assignments like the `bme590hrm` and the heart rate flask application were worth 100 points. You can always see points breakdowns on Sakai). 

This assignment will be due next Wednesday (April 4).
